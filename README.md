Example data formats for the sDIV project *sEcoEvo: Biodiversity Dynamics â€“ The Nexus Between Space & Time*. We are providing example data for all the different data types we are interested in gathering for communities.

* Time calibrated trees (with branch lengths even if unresolved)

An example tree in Newick format is in the file **example.newick**. The structure of the tree looks like this:

* Abundances 

We provide an example site-by-abundance file including 3 sites and the 5 sampled species (B, D, E, F, & K) in the file **example_abundances.txt**. 

* Per location per taxon sequence data (including identical sequences) so that we can include some pop gen. 

Example sequence data is shown in the **fastqs/** directory, with one fastq file per site, including all sequences for all individuals sequenced at that site.
