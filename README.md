Example data formats for the sDIV project *sEcoEvo: Biodiversity Dynamics â€“ The Nexus Between Space & Time*. We are providing example data for all the different data types we are interested in gathering for communities.

* Time calibrated trees (with branch lengths even if unresolved)
An example tree in Newick format is in the file **example.newick**. The structure of the tree looks like this:

* Abundances 


* Per location per taxon sequence data (including identical sequences) so that we can include some pop gen.
